The idea is to group the webservices I featured above into categories.
Then, I will create a dropdown list that people can choose between the services.  Since the returning JSON object will have different properties, I 
will write a wrapper class that will convert their properties to something that my app can understand.

May Not Be Necessary to Code this - I think this does it already
