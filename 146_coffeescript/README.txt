  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

  Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Or, if you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Compile a script:
  coffee /path/to/script.coffee

  For documentation, usage, and examples, see:
