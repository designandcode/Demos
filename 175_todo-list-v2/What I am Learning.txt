Git
=================
Commit Refactorings (Should Refactorings be in a separate branch so they can be merged separately from Feature Commits?)
Commit Complete Features


TDD
=================
Write a new test for each feature
Test various situations
Red, Green, Refactor


Integration Testing
=================
1. Test features in isolation
2. Test features with closest dependencies
3. Test features with all source code


Clean Code
=================
Namespace
Source code should be closed for modification but open for extension.
  1. Good Defaults
  2. Method Arguments
  3. Separate Reusable code blocks and call them when needed in a class (arguments)
  4. Use descriptive text to describe methods like:
      TDONS.Behavior.this_click_delete_selected_items(element);
      Where 
        TDONS = namespace
        Behavior = package
        this_ = element initiating method (put self_ here if the initiating element is also affected by the method)
        click_ = event type
        delete_ = action
        selected_items = element affected by method
   5. Global variables are a good way to access data across domains in the app
