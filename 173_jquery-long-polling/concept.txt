One URL or URL fragment tracked and updated every so often to see what's happening in another URL fragment


URL fragment one (#bar):

gets the result of some operation happening in another fragment every 10 seconds

get the 10 second object from URL fragment two

Some Code:
$(function() {
  function updateMsg() {
    $.ajax({
        url: "#foo",
        cache: false,
        success: function(html) {
            $(#bar).append(html);
        }
    });
    setTimeout('updateMsg()', 15000);
  }
updateMsg();
});


URL fragment two (#foo):

does some business every second, then updates an object that URL fragment one requests the results of every 10 seconds.  This object only updates itself every 10 seconds.

e.g.  add 1 to some number every second, then return the result to another object every ten seconds

Other possible uses:  Update 2nd object only when first object has x number of elements
