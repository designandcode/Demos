Uses Controls like seen in Desktop IDE like Eclipse, Netbean, Flex, Visual Studio and others


Controls dropped onto the state will generate the code needed to build out the page framework.


Controls dropped in can take parameters, properties can be adjusted



E.g.

Image Slider Control

When dropped onto the stage opens a dialog asking for images to use, and parameters.  When Click Okay, the code is generated (HTML, CSS, JS) and folders are updated (
May be able to do the generation from XML, which is what will be updated by section
<xml>
<root>
<control1>
  <html>
  <css>
  <js>
  <files>
</control1>
<control id="slider1">
  .
  .
  .
</control>
</root>

Do it mostly in JavaScript, but since it is web based can use other scripting language like PHP, Ruby, Python, C# (ASP.NET), Java and SQL for back end processing

Things that would need to be processed on the backend include
Storage of files
Packaging of files
Persistence
Image processing
